  are in there when you knock it down?

- Right, I'll fax you through a plan of the school and my teacher's names.
- Yeah, no problem. Yeah.
- And you just make sure that they're all in the building when you knock it down.
- You just make sure you put all their names on it. I'll give you a price for each
  individual teacher.
