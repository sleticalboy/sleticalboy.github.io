# when you are going on a vacation...

# hotel
- arrive at a hotel
- check in/out at the reception
- get keys and a room
- book flights and hotel through internet or in a travel agency
- hotels generally offer full board(all meals covered), half board(breakfast and launch or dinner) or just breakfast
- during peak season, prices can get really high
- rent a car to visit Saint Pertersburg
- what type of hotel and room are you looking for?
- near the city centre with an airconditioned room
- pay by credit card if possible
- making a reservation = booking (they are synonyms)
- check if the Turtle Hotel has any rooms free?
- sorry, the hotel has no vacancies. It's full.
